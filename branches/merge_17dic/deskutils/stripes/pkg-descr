Stripes has been created to produce barcodes using a command line tool
and a graphical user interface, but also comes with a library that
could be used to enable your applications to produce barcodes. 

Stripes is based on Cairo Graphics, which enables it to produce the
output in PDF, PNG and Postscript, with a high quality output.
