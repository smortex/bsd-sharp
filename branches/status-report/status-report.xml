	<body>
		<p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system.</p>
		<p>Mono 2.8 has been released a few days ago and is already available in the BSD# repository.  The updates breaks a few ports so the lang/mono updated in the FreeBSD ports tree will be delayed until those programs are fixed for a smoother update experience.</p>
		<p>Work is in progress to include some long-awaited ports such as deskuils/gnome-do but they require a lot of testing and hacking because they have clearly been designed to run on GNU/Linux and portability has never been a priority (which is quite amusing if you consider portability is the main reason to be for mono).</p>
		<p></p>

	<help>
		<task>If you have some time, test mono ports and send feedback.</task>
		<task>If you have more time, join the BSD# Team! There are many ways to help out!</task>
		<task>Currently low priority, some mono hackers who don't user FreeBSD would be interested in a debug live-image of FreeBSD to help us diagnose and fix bugs more efficiency.</task>
