	<body>
		<p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system.</p>
		<p>During the past year, the BSD# Team continued to track the Mono development and the lang/mono port have almost always been up-to-date (we however had to skip mono-2.2 because of some regression issues in this release).  Most of our patches have been merged in the mono trunk upstream, and should be included in the upcoming mono-2.6 release.</p>
		<p>In the meantime, a few more .NET related ports have been updated or added to the FreeBSD ports tree. These ports include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>www/xsp and www/mod_mono that make it possible to use FreeBSD for hosting ASP.NET application;</li>
			<li>lang/boo, a CLI-targeted programming language similar to Python;</li>
			<li>lang/mono-basic, the Visual Basic.NET Framework for Mono;</li>
			<li>devel/monodevelop, an Integrated Development Environment for .NET;</li>
			<!--li>deskuils/gnome-do, an all-in-one launch-box to perform actions quickly with your computer;</li-->
			<li>and much more...</li>
		</ul>
