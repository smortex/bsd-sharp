	<body>
		<p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system.</p>
		<p>Because of a lack of time, Mono stalled at version 1.2.5 for more than one year in the FreeBSD ports tree. However, things have moved and the BSD# Team is proud to announce that the Mono ports is about to be updated to 2.0.1. Ports depending on Mono will also be updated to the latest available version at the same occasion.</p>
		<p>While the ports will be updated really soon now that FreeBSD 7.1 has been released, impatients can download and merge the BSD# ports in their FreeBSD tree right now following the instructions provided on the BSD# Project's page.</p>
