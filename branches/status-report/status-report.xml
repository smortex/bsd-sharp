		<p>The BSD# Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system.</p>
		<p>Because of a lack of time, Mono stalled at version 1.2.5 for more than one year. However, things have moved and the BSD# Team is proud to announce that the Mono ports is about to be updated to the latest available version (mono-2.0.1) in the FreeBSD ports tree. Ports depending on Mono will also be updated to the latest available version at the same occasion. The code is available form the BSD# Project's website, and will be merged short after FreeBSD 7.1 is released.</p>
