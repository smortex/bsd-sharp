README file for gnome-do-pluginifier

This utility builds a skeleton of gnome-do-plugins meta-port and all
gnome-do-plugin-foo which it brings.

This is mostly an exercise for learning a bit of C# and checking that the port
of MonoDevelop on FreeBSD is stable enough for inclusion into the FreeBSD ports
tree. gnome-do-pluginifier is included in the BSD# repository in the hope it
will help to cope with future gnome-do-plugins.

Beware that this tool only builds a skeleton (that's supposed to be Okay) and
you will have to handle specific dependencies by hand for each plugin.
