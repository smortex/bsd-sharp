2008-12-21  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Ensure that the variable that should be set in the

2008-12-20  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Only consider source ports trees referenced in the
	configuration for operation on them (i.e. do not update unused source
	trees).
	* examples/portshaker.d/bsd_sharp_releng_2_0: Add a source ports tree
	for tracking the 2.0 serie of mono while the porting effort is on 2.2.
	* examples/portshaker.d/Makefile: Install bsd_sharp_releng_2_0 when
	installing examples.
	* examples/portshaker.conf: Explain how to track the branch of
	bsd-sharp holding the 2.0 release.

2008-12-20  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.subr.in: Fixed ports listing for building INDEX.
	* scripts/postPortBuild: Ensure that ports are build with the same set
	of options before copying packages.

2008-11-08  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* README: Provide -I considerations.
	* portshaker.8.in: Document new -I / -i switches.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Add -I / -i switches for updating a target ports
	tree INDEX files.
	* portshaker.subr.in: Reworked INDEX updating so that lines referring
	to ports depending on updated ports are also updated.

2008-11-04  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* INSTALL: `su -` will change the working directory so use just `su`
	to gain root privileges and install portshaker(8).  I chose not to
	rely on sudo(8) since it is not in the base system and that would have
	been another occasion for Baptiste to complain about some details.

2008-11-03  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.subr.in: While "for ... in *" is far more elegant
	than "for ... in `ls`", it will fail with empty directories.

		Reported by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

2008-10-31  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.8.in: Correct information about the $portshaker_info and
	$portshaker_debug environment variables.

2008-10-28  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.subr.in: Replace color escape characters with the
	corresponding ASCII char sequence.

	* Makefile,
	* Makefile.inc,
	* examples/Makefile,
	* examples/Makefile.inc,
	* examples/portshaker.d/Makefile: Make the BSD# portshaker(8)
	configuration install as simple as `make install' in the example
	directory.  Refactor projects Makefiles hierarchy.
	* README: Give pointers on what to do after install.

		Suggested by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

	* examples/README: Reference man page in README.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Add hooking capabilities.
	* portshaker.conf.5.in: Document hooking capabilities for
	portshaker(8).
	* portshaker.subr.in: Update INDEX files when merging ports.

2008-10-20  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* examples/portshaker.conf: Force merge for marcuscom ports.
	* portshaker.d.5.in, portshaker.conf.5.in: Sync examples and man pages
	for the name of the bsd_sharp source ports tree.

		Reported by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Do not check that a source ports tree
	configuration file is executable anymore (to be consistent, it would
	be necessary to also test if it is a regular file, if it is readable
	and even if it exists at all.  Let's keep it simple, and let sh(1)
	tell what the problem is)!  Do not update hidden source ports trees,
	those with an hidden configuration file, when using -U.

		Reported by José María <josemaria@simpleoption.com>,
		After thinking too much about how far we have to check the
		environment.

2008-10-18  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Refactoring of the code for source ports tree
	listing.  Document the usage() function.

	"for ... in *"

	* Makefile: Add tarball target.  Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.conf.5.in: Document modification in portshaker.sh.in.
	Fix ambiguous ports tree reference.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Auto-install conflicting ports when merging using
	portshaker(8) when an exclamation mark was appended to source ports
	tree in portshaker.conf.
	* portshaker.subr.in: More consistent messages.

2008-10-05  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.sh: Remove from repository.
	* portshaker.subr.in: Fixed bug with ports without PORTVERSION (e.g.
	mail/gmime2-sharp). Removed obsolete ports listed in RMPORTS.
