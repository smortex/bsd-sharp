	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.subr.in: While "for ... in *" is far more elegant
	than "for ... in `ls`", it will fail with empty directories.

		Reported by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

2008-10-31  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.8.in: Correct information about the $portshaker_info and
	$portshaker_debug environment variables.

2008-10-28  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.subr.in: Replace color escape characters with the
	corresponding ASCII char sequence.

2008-10-23  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile,
	* Makefile.inc,
	* examples/Makefile,
	* examples/Makefile.inc,
	* examples/portshaker.d/Makefile: Make the BSD# portshaker(8)
	configuration install as simple as `make install' in the example
	directory.  Refactor projects Makefiles hierarchy.
	* README: Give pointers on what to do after install.

		Suggested by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

	* examples/README: Reference man page in README.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Add hooking capabilities.
	* portshaker.conf.5.in: Document hooking capabilities for
	portshaker(8).
	* portshaker.subr.in: Update INDEX files when merging ports.

2008-10-20  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* examples/portshaker.conf: Force merge for marcuscom ports.
	* portshaker.d.5.in, portshaker.conf.5.in: Sync examples and man pages
	for the name of the bsd_sharp source ports tree.

		Reported by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Do not check that a source ports tree
	configuration file is executable anymore (to be consistent, it would
	be necessary to also test if it is a regular file, if it is readable
	and even if it exists at all.  Let's keep it simple, and let sh(1)
	tell what the problem is)!  Do not update hidden source ports trees,
	those with an hidden configuration file, when using -U.

		Reported by José María <josemaria@simpleoption.com>,
		After thinking too much about how far we have to check the
		environment.

2008-10-18  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Refactoring of the code for source ports tree
	listing.  Document the usage() function.
	* portshaker.subr.in: Replace a "for ... in `ls`" by a more elegant
	"for ... in *"

	* Makefile: Add tarball target.  Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.conf.5.in: Document modification in portshaker.sh.in.
	Fix ambiguous ports tree reference.
	* portshaker.sh.in: Auto-install conflicting ports when merging using
	portshaker(8) when an exclamation mark was appended to source ports
	tree in portshaker.conf.
	* portshaker.subr.in: More consistent messages.

2008-10-05  Romain Tartière  <romain@blogreen.org>

	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* portshaker.sh: Remove from repository.
	* portshaker.subr.in: Fixed bug with ports without PORTVERSION (e.g.
	mail/gmime2-sharp). Removed obsolete ports listed in RMPORTS.

	* Initial code.
