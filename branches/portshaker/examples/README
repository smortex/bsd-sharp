This directory contains the portshaker(8) configuration for merging BSD# ports
with the development version of GNOME in the default location of the FreeBSD
ports tree.

After installing, update your FreeBSD ports tree with:
portshaker -UMI

Note that the -I flag is required if you want to use an up-to-date INDEX file,
however, since the update process is quite long (5000+ ports depends on updated
packages in the MarcusCom repository), you can skip it if you do not use the
INDEX file (e.g. you build ports in a tinderbox).
