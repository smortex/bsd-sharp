portshaker(8) is designed to maintain a set of FreeBSD ports trees.

For install instructions, please refer to the INSTALL file.  After installing,
you will have to configure portshaker(8) since it is a toolkit and does nothing
out of the box.  Configuration instructions are provided in the distribution
man pages: portshaker(8), portshaker.conf(5) and portshaker.d(5).

If you intend to test BSD#, a complete configuration that will work out of the
box is available from the examples directory.

Portions of sources of this tools code have been stolen from the following
files from a FreeBSD 7.0-STABLE box:
  - /etc/rc.subr
  - /usr/share/man/man5/rc.conf.5.gz
