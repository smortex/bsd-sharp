FreeBSD ports for Mono related applications and libraries.

The BSD# Project is devoted to porting and maintaining the Mono .NET
framework for FreeBSD. The Mono framework consists of not only the Mono
Runtime environment and compiler but the XSP webserver for handling
ASP.NET applications, the IKVM Java virtual machine for handling Java
within the framework, and numerous data providers to provide common
library functions in C# or intergration with existing C libraries.

The BSD# CVS repository currently contains FreeBSD ports for all Mono
packages released by Novell. It also includes ports for applications and
libraries from third parties as well with the intent that they be
intergrated into the standard FreeBSD ports tree. The project aims to
act as a central testing point for porting new releases from Novell, for
introducing new applications, and for testing framework wide changes
that will affect all applications that rely on Mono before they reach
the FreeBSD ports tree.
