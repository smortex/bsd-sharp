TagLib# is a FREE and Open Source library for the .NET 2.0 and Mono
frameworks which will let you tag your software with as much or as 
little detail as you like without slowing you down. It supports a 
large variety of movie and music formats which abstract away the 
work, handling all the different cases, so all you have to do is
access file.Tag.Title, file.Tag.Lyrics, or my personal favorite 
file.Tag.Pictures.
