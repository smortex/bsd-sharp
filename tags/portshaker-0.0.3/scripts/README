This directory contain handy scripts to work with portshaker(8).

postPortBuild:
	Post port build hook for tinderbox.  On successful packaging of a port,
	the script will look in all other builds and see if the version of the
	port they provide is the same as the one that was just compiled.  If
	so, the package is copied to the other build and its status is updated
	accordingly, avoiding an unnecessary compilation of the port in the
	other build.

	To install:
	./tc updateHookCmd -h postPortBuild -c /path/to/postPortBuild
