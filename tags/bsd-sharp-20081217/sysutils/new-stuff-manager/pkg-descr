NewStuffManager is a program that runs in the background and downloads/installs
plugins. It can be used by any application through its D-Bus interface.

The idea for NewStuffManager emerged from the Deskbar-Applet project. 
The goal for NewStuffManager is to provide an easy way to upgrade plugins of 
any application. Therefore, it is very easy for developers to enhance their 
application with a plugin update service.
