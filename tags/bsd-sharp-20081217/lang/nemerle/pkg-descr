Nemerle is a high-level statically-typed programming language for the .NET
platform. It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative features. It has
a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful meta-programming system.

Features that come from the functional land are variants, pattern matching,
type inference and parameter polymorphism (aka generics). Meta-system allows
great compiler extensibility, embedding domain specific languages, partial
evaluation and aspect-oriented programming.
