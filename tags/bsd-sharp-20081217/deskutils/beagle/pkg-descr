Beagle is an experimental tool for indexing and searching your local
files. Using Beagle, you can search your office documents, images,
music files, and your source code.

Beagle is written in C# using Mono and Gtk#. The indexing is handled by
Lucene.Net, a C# port of the Lucene indexer. The source code lives in
the GNOME CVS repository in the module beagle.
