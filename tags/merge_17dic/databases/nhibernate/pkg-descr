NHibernate is a .NET based object persistence library for relational databases.
NHibernate is a port of the excellent Java Hibernate relational persistence
tool.

(If you are courious about what Hibernate is: Hibernate is a powerful,
ultra-high performance object/relational persistence and query service for Java.
Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes following common Java idiom -
including association, inheritance, polymorphism, composition and the Java
collections framework. The Hibernate Query Language, designed as a "minimal"
object-oriented extension to SQL, provides an elegant bridge between the object
and relational worlds. Hibernate also allows you to express queries using
native SQL or Java-based Criteria and Example queries.)
