.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portshaker.conf
.Nd format of the
.Xr portshaker 8
configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm
contains descriptive information about which
.Ar source
ports trees
.Xr portshaker 8
has to be merged into which
.Ar target
ports trees.
.Pp
Options are set with
.Dq Ar name Ns Li = Ns Ar value
assignments that use
.Xr sh 1
syntax.
The following list provides a name and short description for each
variable that can be set in the
.Nm
file:
.Bl -tag
.It Va mirror_base_dir
.Pq Vt str
Base directory where
.Xr portshaker 8
will fetch
.Ar source
ports trees.
.It Va contributed_repositories
.Pq Vt str
Set to the list of
.Ar target
ports trees to maintain.
.Pp
A
.Ao Ar target Ac Ns Va _ports_tree
variable must be set to tell
.Xr portshaker 8
where the ports trees has to be merged and a
.Ao Ar target Ac Ns Va _merge_from
variable must be set to the list of
.Ar source
ports trees to merge from.
.Pp
If a
.Ar source
ports tree is known to provide ports that are already provided in another ports
tree, and while both ports provide the same version of a software package they
do not contain the same files,
.Xr portshaker 8
can be told to automatically install the updated ports without prompting the
user by appending an exclamation mark after the
.Ar source
ports tree name.

.Bd -literal
contributed_repositories="tb_official tb_bsd_sharp tb_gnome tb_bsd_sharp_gnome"

tb="@@DESTDIR@@/tinderbox/"
tb_official_ports_tree="${tb}/portstrees/FreeBSD/ports"
tb_official_merge_from="freebsd"

tb_bsd_sharp_ports_tree="${tb}/portstrees/BSD-sharp/ports"
