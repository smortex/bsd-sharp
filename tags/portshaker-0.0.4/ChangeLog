	* Makefile: Bumped VERSION.
	* examples/portshaker.conf: Force merge for marcuscom ports.
	* portshaker.d.5.in, portshaker.conf.5.in: Sync examples and man pages
	for the name of the bsd_sharp source ports tree.

		Reported by: Baptiste Grenier <baptiste@bapt.name>

	* portshaker.sh.in: Do not check that a source ports tree
	configuration file is executable anymore (to be consistent, it would
	be necessary to also test if it is a regular file, if it is readable
	and even if it exists at all.  Let's keep it simple, and let sh(1)
	tell what the problem is)!  Do not update hidden source ports trees,
	thoses with an hidden configuration file, when using -U.

		Reported by José María <josemaria@simpleoption.com>,
		After thinking too much about how far we have to check the
		environment.

	* portshaker.sh.in: Refactoring of the code for source ports tree
