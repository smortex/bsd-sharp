#summary Organization of the Subversion repository
#labels Phase-QA
= Introduction =

The BSD# Project maintains a partial ports tree intended to be merged in the FreeBSD ports tree using portshaker. The partial ports tree is under the version control system (VCS) provided by Google: [http://subversion.tigris.org Subversion].


= Organisation of the VCS tree =

== Trunk ==
`/trunk` is the place where development takes place. It is possible that ports provided by `trunk` are broken, have leftovers, etc.

If you want to help-out in bringing Mono to FreeBSD, it is location to check-out.

== Branches ==
`/branches` contains various  utilities that do not fit in the `trunk` but are related to the BSD# Project, and old versions of the `trunk` that are to be considered stable. Theese versions are used by the BSD# Team to maintain the version of mono curently in the FreeBSD ports tree while working on the future version in `trunk`.

Examples:
 * `/branches/bsd-sharp-2.0` Maintenance branch of the BSD# partial ports tree providing mono-2.0.
 * `/branches/bsd-sharp-2.2` Maintenance branch of the BSD# partial ports tree providing mono-2.2.
== Tags ==

`/tags` contains snapshots of the branches. The content of a tag never change.

= Creating a branch =

To create a new branch (e.g. `trunk` has mono-2.0 and mono-2.2 is under development) copy the trunk to the new branch using:

{{{
svn copy https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd-sharp-2.0 -m "Create bsd-sharp-2.0 branch for mono-2.0 maintenance."
}}}

The porting effort can now continue:
 * mono-2.2 stuff can be introduce in `trunk`;
 * updates of the mono-2.0 ports are made into the branch:
{{{
svn checkout https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd-sharp-2.0
}}}

= Creating Tags =

When a branch is considered stable, tag it using the date in the form YYYYMMDD:
{{{
svn copy https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd-sharp-2.0 https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/tags/bsd-sharp-20081218 -m "TAG bsd-sharp-20081218."
}}}

You can then send a problem report mentioning the tag. If you want to send a diff in your PR, use svn ask for a diff between your tag and the previous one:

{{{
svn diff https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/tags/bsd-sharp-20081218  https://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/tags/bsd-sharp-20090204
}}}
