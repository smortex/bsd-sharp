= [http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:FreeBSD Mono:FreeBSD] page =

The BSD# page on the Mono website (http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:FreeBSD) is outdated.

I (romain) used the contact form to have some pointers in ~ december 2008 but did not have an answer.

= BROKEN Ports =

The following ports are known to fail with the current infrastructure:

  * deskutils/beagle (upstream does not support gmime2-sharp-2.4)


= Fix linuxisms =

The following projects are known to rely on linuxisms that may have to be worked around a better may and for witch patches have to be send upstream:

|| *port*                 || *linuxism*    || *status* ||
|| audio/last-exit        || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||
|| deskutils/giver        || PrctlLinuxism || TODO || 
|| deskutils/tasque       || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||
|| deskutils/tomboy-devel || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||

= Check ports =

The `portlint` utility (`ports-mgmt/portlint`) can detect problems in ports. All BSD# ports have to be verified with this tool.

= Build ports with NOPORTDOCS defined =

... and fix accordingly.
