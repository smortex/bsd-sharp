= [http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:FreeBSD Mono:FreeBSD] page =

The BSD# page on the Mono website (http://www.mono-project.com/Mono:FreeBSD) is outdated.

I (romain) used the contact form to have some pointers in ~ december 2008 but did not have an answer.

= Failing tests (`cd lang/mono && make tests`) =

== amd64 ==

|| *mono-2.0* || *mono-2.2*        || *mono-2.4*        ||
||            || pinvoke2.exe      || pinvoke2.exe      ||
||            || winx64structs.exe || winx64structs.exe ||

== i386 ==

|| *mono-2.0* || *mono-2.2*        || *mono-2.4*        ||

= BROKEN Ports =

The following ports are known to fail with the current infrastructure:

  * devel/monodevelop-boo (./Gui/OptionPanels/GeneralShellPanel.boo(47,9): BCE0047: Method 'GLib.Object.get_Properties()' cannot be overridden because it is not virtual)

  * deskutils/beagle (upstream does not support gmime2-sharp-2.4)


= Fix linuxisms =

The following projects are known to rely on linuxisms that may have to be worked around a better may and for witch patches have to be send upstream:

|| *port*                 || *linuxism*    || *status* ||
|| audio/last-exit        || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||
|| deskutils/giver        || PrctlLinuxism || TODO || 
|| deskutils/tasque       || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||
|| deskutils/tomboy-devel || PrctlLinuxism || TODO ||

= Check ports =

The `portlint` utility (`ports-mgmt/portlint`) can detect problems in ports. All BSD# ports have to be verified with this tool.

= Build ports with NOPORTDOCS defined =

... and fix accordingly.
