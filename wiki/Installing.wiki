#summary How to have cutting edge mono on FreeBSD

= Choose which BSD# branch to track =

First, have a look to the [Branches] of mono ports maintained by the BSD# Team and make yourself an idea of what you want to track.

== Install _portshaker_ ==

Either downlaod and extract a tarball from the download section or checkout the code using the following command:
{{{
svn co "http://bsd-sharp.googlecode.com/svn/branches/portshaker/"
}}}

Then build and install _portshaker_:
{{{
make PREFIX="/usr/local"
sudo make PREFIX="/usr/local" install
}}}

For convenience, _portshaker_ ships with example configuration files for tracking the `trunk`, where the porting effort is concentrated. Install the examples running:
{{{
make -C examples PREFIX="/usr/local" install
}}}

The default configuration file should fit your needs, but you can customise it: `/usr/local/etc/portshaker.conf`.

== Update your ports ==

Updating your FreeBSD ports tree, your copy of the BSD# repository and meging them is as easy as running _portshaker_:

{{{
portshaker
}}}

The default behaviour is to update and merge all configured ports tree.


== Updating you ports ==

Since the BSD# ports tree is merged into the FreeBSD ports tree, you can update your ports the usual way (using _portupgrade_ for example).
