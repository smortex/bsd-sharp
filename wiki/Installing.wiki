#summary How to have cutting edge mono on FreeBSD
#labels Featured


= Choose which BSD# branch to track =

First, have a look to the [Branches] of mono ports maintained by the BSD# Team and make yourself an idea of what you want to track.

== Install _portshaker_ ==

Portshaker is now in the FreeBSD ports, so installing it with a working configuration is as simple as:

{{{
make -C /usr/ports/ports-mgmt/portshaker-config install
}}}

== Update your ports ==

Updating your FreeBSD ports tree, your copy of the BSD# repository and meging them is as easy as running _portshaker_:

{{{
portshaker
}}}

The default behaviour is to update and merge all configured ports tree.


== Updating you ports ==

Since the BSD# ports tree is merged into the FreeBSD ports tree, you can update your ports the usual way (using _portupgrade_ for example).
